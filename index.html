JavaScript can be used to manipulate HTML and CSS elements, create animations and effects, and interact with external data sources through APIs. It also has a wide range of frameworks and libraries available that can be used to build more complex web applications. JavaScript is an essential component of modern web development, and it is widely used in web development, mobile app development, and other software applications.</p>
